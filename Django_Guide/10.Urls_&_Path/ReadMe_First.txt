Using Terminal/CMD/Command Prompt/Powershell & Browser (Google Chrome, Opera, Fire Fox, explorer and etc) & IDE/Text Editor (eg.Vs Code, Subline) 

Python(.py) script/file to use : urls.py , views.py

**Note
Continue from Django_Guide : 06.Home_Page

1. Edit Views.py File/Script

Following the example of Django_Guide 06.Home_Page Step,  you may add many views as you like, with a touch of html code/language as you can see on (screenshot 01.Edit_Views) for an examples

To understand this better you need to study :

* Python proggramming Language
* Html Codes

*Note : Note to study that need much time, for now you may copy and paste

2. Edit Urls.py Files/Script (Routing Path)

First thing to  do here if you know new, follow the instructions written above on urls.py file/script (check my screenshot 02.Urls_Instructions)

quick guide : import views.py file/script from the app(in my case "Page")

add the path/location for your views to route on the browser (screenshot 03.Adding_Path)

**Note : if you give incorrect path on your browser, your terminal and browser will point out the correct path ( see screenshot 04.Incorrect_Path)

if you point/ route in correct path, html code / messages written on views.py file/script should appear (see screenshot 05.Correct_Path)
