Using Terminal/CMD/Command Prompt/Powershell & Browser (Google Chrome, Opera, Fire Fox, explorer and etc) & IDE/Text Editor (eg.Vs Code, Subline) 


Script/File to use : Settings.py, home.html, base.html
Script/File to create : home.css, base. css

1. Create a folder named Stactic/StaticFiles, a folder which will house js, css, images, media fonts and etc. (see screenshot 01.Create_Folder)

2 Put/type a StaticFiles Directory/ Path inside settings.py file (see screenshot 02.Edit_Settings)

3. Create CSS Files (in mycase base.css, home.css) as you can see on screenshot 03.CSS_Files. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts (see screenshot 04.Base_CSS & 05.Home_CSS), CSS works perfectly fine with html and js (see screenshot 06.Edit_Home_Html & 07.Edit_Base_Html )

**Note that CSS is markup language like HTML, it needs more time to study 

4. Make sure all files are saved and run the browser see different output (see screenshot 08.Browser_Home & 09.Browser_Information)
