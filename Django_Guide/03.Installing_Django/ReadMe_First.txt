Using Terminal/CMD/Command Prompt/Powershell

Go to official Django website, Choose the django version you would like to work with, Recommended version is the one before the latest.
(in my case Django 3.2.5)

1.Install Django

>> pip install Django==3.2.6

*** Please Note >> pip install Pillow
				>> pip install django-crispy-forms is optional not necessary at this stage.you might need it later.

2. Comfirmation/Checking Django

>> pip freeze
(all installed django libraries should show up on the terminal, check screenshot for an examples )
You can also show the installed libraries on txt file by typing

>> pip freeze > requirements.txt
