Using Terminal/CMD/Command Prompt/Powershell

1. Create An Djabgo App
(Not to be confused with the apps we download on apps strore, playstore)

To create app you need to typing on the Terminal:

python manage.py startapp anyname

(anyname= give your app a name like, blog, pages, product, stream, and more depending on what you are working on)

** Note in my case i chose : python manage.py startapp Page

(Page : Notice the name of the app, first letter in uppercase, keep in mind, cause you will use it in future for importing to some python (.py) file )

The Folder named "Page" will appear with some python (.py) file inside
(check screenshot 01, and 02 for an example)
